Higher or Lower Card Game Simulation
This project simulates a card game where players guess if the next card drawn will be higher or lower. Players place bets, and if they guess correctly, they win 1.7x their bet amount. The game automatically progresses through rounds, accepting bets, drawing cards, and updating player balances.
